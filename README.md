# UnifiedTracker
This is the main repository for the UnifiedTracker Project

UnifiedTracker is a versatile platform that integrates multiple tracking functionalities into a single web application. It allows users to monitor environmental conditions, such as room humidity, and track personal health metrics, such as weight. Those are the first features to be implemented. Further ideas will be added.
I changed that to humidity_tracker. I want to use different tools, to learn more instead of doing the same stuff.
